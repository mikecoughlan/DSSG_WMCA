# Targeting Areas for Retrofit in the West Midlands (DSSGxUK 2022)

**Partners**: [West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA)](https://www.wmca.org.uk) and [Pure Leapfrog](https://www.pureleapfrog.org) 

**Aim**: Develop strategy for retrofitting houses in the West Midlands to increase energy efficiency and reduce non-renewable energy usage.

**Insights**
1. EPC and heating type predictions for houses without a rating 
2. Estimated solar PV output from houses
3. Additional load on electricity network if houses switched from non-electric to electric heating

The code to run for each insight sits in a different folder with its own `README.md` on how to run it.
